A wrapper around various functional/system browser testing modules, mainly selenium and zc.testbrowser.
Intended to allow for the selection of desired test mechanism, but running the same test code in all

By necessity, will be fairly simple, and will not support complex specific features of the underlying test suites.

Currently supported:
	selenium v1
	zc.testbrowser
